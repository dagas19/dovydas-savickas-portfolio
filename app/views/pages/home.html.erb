        I decided change my career from construction worker to something than I would enjoy doing and all my life I was into computers either gaming or fixing them I been working with computer for long time and I'm passionate about it. So I found programming. So I decided get into this field and I joined Le Wagon bootcamp where I learned web development skills. I never thought office work could be interesting but when Im working with code I really get into it I enjoy doing it learning new skills all the time and building something new. Currently Im learning React my improving my skills farther I'm also interested in other in Js frameworks. Despite my enjoyment with coding I also am very active person I love working out, snowboarding and living healthy lifestyle. </p>
